Comfortably create Child Themes as well as quickly change the Theme to see what your website or publications with different Themes look like.

== Description ==
This plugin quickly generates a Child Theme from the top menu. It shows the list of available Themes of your Wordpress with the information of
each.
<br />
A child theme is a theme developed from a parent theme, which inherits its basic functionality. Although the child theme includes most of the features of its parent theme, it is a theme that does not update directly
<br />
Under each theme information there are 2 quick access buttons:

- **Custom Child**: Open the form for the creation of Child Theme.
- **Change / See**: Change the current theme for the selected one (this change is only reflected for the administrator for testing purposes).
